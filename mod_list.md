* Squad & Burrow Icons
* Interface Tweaks (Without Hotkey Hints)
* Grind bones and shells into flux (and more)
* Sand & Clay Anywhere

Note: `Shy Nobles` should be put BEFORE `Grind bones and shells into flux (and more)`. Refer to `dfhack-config/mod-manager.json` for more information. After creating a new world, use following ways to check if both mods work properly.

* Use DFHack command `make-monarch` and check the new noble's requirements.
* Use keyword `bone` to search work orders. There should be new orders to grind bones.
